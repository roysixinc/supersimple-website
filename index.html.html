      The ARPAnet which was conceived by Advanced Research Project Agency(ARPA)
      of the united states government in 1969. it's original aim would allow users of 
      one university "talk to" other research computers of other universities.
      In 1983 the ARPAnet transtioned into using Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)
      /Internet Protocol(IP) open networking protocol suite and in 1985 the National Science Foundation Network(NSFN)
      desinged the network to conect univesity computer science depertment around the country 
      
        Benefit of the ARPAnet was because messages could be routed or rerouted in more than one direction, the Network would function even
        if it's part were destroyed in an event of a millitary attack or any other disaster

        Communications over the Internet greatly improved in 1989 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
        was created, giving computer platforms the ability to connect to some Internet sites. In 1993, the 
        Mossaic Web Browser was created.
        (This the first browser to be created to display images with text instead of in a seperate window.It is often described as the first
        graphical web browser.)Though preceded by WWW the lesser know Erwise.

      <h3>
        How the internet works 
      </h3>
    <p class="works-net">
      Physically, the Internet uses a portion of the 
      total resources of the currently existing public 
      <u>telecommunication networks</u>. Technically,
       what distinguishes the Internet is its use of a
        set of protocols called Transmission Control
         Protocol/Internet Protocol <u>(TCP/IP)</u>. 
         Two recent adaptations of Internet technology, the Intranet and the <u>extranet</u>, also make use of the TCP/IP protocol.

The Internet can be seen as having two major components: <u>network protocols</U> and hardware. The protocols, such as the TCP/IP suite, present sets of rules that devices must follow in order to complete tasks. Without this common collection of rules, machines would not be able to communicate.

The protocols are also responsible for translating the alphabetic text of a message into electronic signals that can be transmitted over the Internet, and then back again into legible, alphabetic text.

Hardware, the second major component of the Internet, includes everything from the computer or <u>smartphone</u> that is used to access the Internet to the cables that carry information from one device to another. Additional types of hardware include satellites, radios, cell phone towers, routers and servers.

These various types of hardware are the connections within the network. Devices such as computers, smartphones and <u>laptops</u> are end points, or <u>clients</u>, while the machines that store the information are the <u>servers</u>. The transmission lines that exchange the data can either be wireless signals from satellites or 4G and cell phone towers, or physical lines, such as cables and <u>fiber optics</u>.

The process of transferring information from one device to another relies on packet switching. Each computer connected to the Internet is assigned a unique <u>IP</u> <u>address</u> that allows the device to be recognized. When one device attempts to send a message to another device, the data is sent over the Internet in the form of manageable <u>packets</u>. Each packet is assigned a <U>port</U> number that will connect it to its endpoint.

A packet that has both a unique IP address and port number can be translated from alphabetic text into electronic signals by travelling through the layers of the <u>OSI model</u>from the top <u>application layer</u> to the bottom <u>physical layer</u>. The message will then be sent over the Internet where it is received by the Internet service provider's <u>(ISP)</u> router. The router will examine the destination address assigned to each packet and determine where to send it.

Eventually, the packet reaches the client and travels in reverse from the bottom physical layer of the OSI model to the top application layer. During this process, the routing data -- the port number and IP address -- is stripped from the packet, thus allowing the data to be translated back into alphabetic text and completing the transmission process.

    <h4>Uses of the Internet</h4>
    <p class="uses-net">
      In general, the Internet can be used to communicate across large or small distances, share information from any place in the world and access information or answers to almost any question in moments.

Some specific examples of how the Internet is used include:

<br><li><u>Social media</u> and content sharing;</li>
  
<br><li>E-mail and other forms of communication, such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Internet telephony, <u>instant messaging</u>, <u>video conferencing</u></li>
<br><li>Education and self-improvement through access to online degree programs, courses and workshops and</li>
<br><li>Searching for jobs -- both the employer and applicant use the Internet to post open positions, apply for jobs and recruit individuals found on social networking sites like <u>LinkedIn</u>.</li>

  <P class="it">Other examples include:</p>

<br><li><u>Online discussion groups and forums</u></li>
<br><li>Online dating</li>
<br><li>Online gaming</li>
<br><li>Research</li>
<br><li>Reading electronic newspapers and magazines</li>
<br><li>Online shopping, or e-commerce.</li>
